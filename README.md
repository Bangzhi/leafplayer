# LeafPlayer

LeafPlayer is a privately hosted music streaming server. It enables you to access your private music collection from anywhere where there's internet access.

## Quick start

To use LeafPlayer, you need to own a server, capable of running the [Lumen PHP framework](https://lumen.laravel.com/) as this is the core of the LeafPlayer backend.

## Short History

In early 2016 I was searching for a music streaming server to fit my needs, but none of the available alternatives could really satisfy me, which is why I decided to create my own.

> How hard can it be?

As it turned out, it was - and still is - a lot of work for one person, which is why I'm searching for active contributors for the project to create something amazing.


## Contributing

I'm sure that's nothing new for you, but first you need to clone the project locally.
```sh
$ cd /path/to/your/directory
$ git clone git@github.com:paulschwoerer/leafplayer.git
```

If this is done, decide, please see the contribution guide for either the [frontend](frontend/README.md) or the [backend](backend/README.md).
