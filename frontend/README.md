# LeafPlayer Frontend

> Frontend for the LeafPlayer personal music streaming server.

## Contributing

To contribute to the LeafPlayer frontend you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your machine. The package manager [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is also required, but should be included in Node.js.

Currently an instance of the backend needs to be running locally for the frontend to connect to, please see the contributing section in the [README](../backend/README.md) for the backend.

After cloning the project to your machine, run the following commands to start a dev server.
``` bash
# move into frontend directory
cd frontend

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```
The LeafPlayer frontend is based on the Vue.js [Webpack template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack), see the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) for a full list of available commands and options.
For easily creating components there are [Seng Generator](https://github.com/mediamonks/seng-generator) templates available in the [template](template) folder.

Happy coding!
